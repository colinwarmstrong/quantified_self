# Quantified Self

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/colinwarmstrong/quantified_self.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/colinwarmstrong/quantified_self) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/colinwarmstrong/quantified_self/badge.svg?branch=testing)](https://coveralls.io/github/colinwarmstrong/quantified_self?branch=testing)

Quantified Self is an API built to serve as the backend for an application designed to track daily food intake. It is built using Rails and a Postgres database.  The project was built as part of the curriculum for the backend program at Turing School of Software and Design. The project spec can be found [here](http://backend.turing.io/module4/projects/quantified_self/quantified_self_rails).  


## Getting Started

These instructions will get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need access to a terminal application and a text editor.

### Installing

From your terminal, clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/colinwarmstrong/quantified_self.git
```

Change into the directory:

```
cd quantified_self
```

Install and update gems:

```
bundle install
bundle update
```

Setup the database:

```
rake db:{drop,create,migrate,seed}
```

The repository is now setup on your local machine. To run a local version of the repository, first spin up a local Rails server:

```
rails s
```

Once the server is up and running, visit [http://localhost:3000/api/v1/foods](http://localhost:3000/api/v1/foods) or any of the other endpoints to see the JSON that is returned.


## Running the tests

The test suite is built using RSpec.  To run the test suite after you have set up the repository locally, run `bundle exec rspec` from the command line.

## Endpoints
